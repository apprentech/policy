Apprentech.io Apprentice Policy
====

```
* Apprentices will be paid for material contributions made to any startups or other businesses that the directors/trainers are involved in
* All code produced by apprentices, which is of a reasonable quality (decided by quorum of peers), will be open-sourced if not directly related to abovementioned startups
* All git codebases should be forked into personal repositories, and PRs should be raised against code
* All code, unless related to abovementioned startups, must be stored within github.com/apprentech/, give explicit recognition to the author, and be appropriately licensed
* Priority will be given to apprentices that devote more time, show greater promise, and help their fellow apprentices
* Humility, respect for others, willingness to learn & teach others, kindness toward others, and continual focus on fostering a growth-orientated environment are ABSOLUTE prerequisites
* Any behaviour which is deemed unacceptable will be justification for immediate termination of apprenticeship. This may include: threatening behaviour, harassment of any kind, repeated tardiness, unwillingness to help your fellow practitioners, disruptive or unpleasant behavior, etc
* Apprentices are responsible for insuring any personal equipment that they bring on-site, and the directors/trainers will not be held responsible for any damage caused intentionally, negligently, or otherwise, by any participants to the program
* Apprentices are invited to share articles or work on our Facebook, LinkedIn or other pages, and are asked to maintain a respectful tone at all times
* This policy is very much a work in progress, and will develop as the program matures
